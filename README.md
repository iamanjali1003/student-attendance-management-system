## About

The **Student Attendance Management System** is a database-driven application designed to manage and track student attendance across courses and departments.

This project demonstrates key database concepts such as normalization, entity-relationship modeling, table creation with constraints, SQL queries (CRUD, joins, aggregates), triggers, and stored procedures.

## Features

- Manage students, courses, faculty, and departments
- Record daily attendance with status (Present, Absent, Late)
- Enforce data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
- Execute CRUD operations and complex queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions
- Automatically log changes to attendance records using triggers
- Optional stored procedures and cursors for advanced operations
